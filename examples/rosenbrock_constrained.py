DFO-LS example: minimize the Rosenbrock function with arbitrary convex constraints

This example defines two functions pball(x) and pbox(x) that project onto ball and
box constraint sets respectively. It then passes both these functions to the DFO-LS
solver so that it can find a constrained minimizer to the Rosenbrock function.
Such a minimizer must lie in the intersection of constraint sets corresponding to
projection functions pball(x) and pbox(x). The description of the problem is as follows:

    min rosenbrock(x)
    s.t.
        -2 <= x[0] <= 1.1,
        1.1 <= x[1] <= 3,
        norm(x-c) <= 0.4

where c = [0.7, 1.5] is the centre of the ball.
